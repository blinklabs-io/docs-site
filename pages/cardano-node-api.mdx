# Cardano Node API

The Cardano Node API service is a companion service to the IntersectMBO Haskell
Cardano Node. It provides access to the internal Node-to-Client UNIX socket of
the Cardano Node via multiple HTTP protocols.

## Why HTTP?

The HTTP protocol is the default language of the web. It's used by social
networks and video streaming services. It's used by this documentation. There
are decades of products, practices, and policies in place to facilitate the
transport and security of HTTP. Everything from firewalls to mobile phones are
built to support this protocol.
